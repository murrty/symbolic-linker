# symbolic-linker
Create symbolic links for files and folders, as well as their alternatives for Windows.

## What do?
Creates symbolic file links, symbolic folder links, hard file links, and folder junctions.

It's recommended to stick with symbolic links instead of hard file links or folder junctions, because symbolic links are basically glorified shortcuts and are preserved better than hard links or junctions.

You can read more about what each does in the application when you press "help", it's what I have read on each types of file links.

## How do?
When running Symbolic Linker with no arguments, it'll give you a display of options you can do.

## When do?
After you specify the requested paths for files or folders.

## Why?
So I can save hard drive space, and you can, too.
